# OkCupid Data a Scientist
 
Code Project made by Luis Zúñiga Araya

In this project, data collected from an app called OkCupid will be subjected to analysis, the data corresponds to questions which were answered with multiple choice and short answers, which were used to make matches between users. As we know, these apps use data science to predict possible matches between users, taking into account their tastes and what characteristics relate them to each other.

### Project Goal

The goal of this project is to make an analysis about a data from the OkCupid app. This type of app is responsible for analyzing characteristics between users to recommend a possible match. To do this, the project must analyze the characteristics of each user and be able to analyze their compatibility with others, in addition to seeking the most optimal compatibility.

### Project Data

This project has one data set, it is a huge dataset that contain a lot of information of each user. Data by Codecademy.com.

### Analysis

To understand better the data, the project will focus on distributions, number of species, relationship between them, conservation status and observation of the species on each park.

### Evaluation

Acording to the project goals, the output of the anlysis needs to be check to see if there are any pattern found, the distribution of the species and some extra conclusions. In this section we will analyze whether we should have used a different methodology to make the project.
